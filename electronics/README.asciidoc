== Functionality

This board has two sides that have separate power and ground and are iseolated from one another with isolators.
Microcontroller is powered by 5 V USB connector that is stepped down to 3.3 V by voltage regulator.
Microcontroller is programmed through programmer connector and can communicate through USB connector.
The motor drivers are powerd by 4s LiPo battery that is stepped down to 5V by buck converter.
The motor drivers are controlled by direction and PWM signal.
