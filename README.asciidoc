=== Rasmus

I worked mostly on programming tasks.
Some times I also helped Michelle and Leonid with their tasks if it was blocking my progress.
I learned about the basketball rules and how to build a bigger Python program in a readable way.
Next I'd allocate more time for the course and start with things more earlier in the course.
Also I'd use more of the given code not wanting to do everything myself.
I liked working together with my teammates on the robot and bouncing ideas how to solve some programming challenges.
For next year students I'd recommend to start early in the course with presenting the tasks because they will not have enough time in the end of the course.
Also to take part of the lab sessions.
For instructors I'd recommend to have individual meetings / presenting the tasks with the team.
That would help to find planning errors earlier and would lessen the amount of work in the end of the semester.
