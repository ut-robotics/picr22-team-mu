== Functionality

This firmware is used on Î¼ mainboard and motor driver board.
It generates PWM signals for moving 3 gearmotors for wheels and a brushless motor for throwing.
Wheel motors are controlled with PI algorithm by using feedback from encoders.


== Data format

The data can be sent and recieved in the following format:

. 16-bit motor1 speed
. 16-bit motor2 speed
. 16-bit motor3 speed
. 16-bit thrower speed
. 16-bit delimiter

All the data is sent in little endian byte order.
Thrower values range from 1000 to 2000.
That means the thrower is static at 1000 and maximally mobile at 2000.
Disable failsafe mode is always on so new input must be sent at least every 1 second to keep the robot moving.
Delimeter must be 0xAAAA. +

Example: 0A 00 0A 00 0A 00 14 05 AA AA +
All wheels are rotating with the speed of 10 and thrower speed of 1300.
